            <p>As a developer, I’m driven by curiosity and the thrill of problem-solving. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, which led me to experiment with building websites, hosting my own servers, and developing various software projects from a young age. I’m not just about coding for the sake of it, I love to explore, break things down, and make them better. I find a great sense of satisfaction developing solutions and I'm severely set on numbers and statistics, be it users or revenue.</p>
            <p>I’m comfortable working with <strong>PHP, Java & TypeScript</strong>, as I appreciate their logical structure. I enjoy creating solutions that are efficient, scalable, and secure, and I’m always learning new things working on backend systems using an array of languages.</p>
            <p>My development experience dates back to 2016, when I first came into contact with Scratch & JavaScript by developing small games and trading bots. Ever since those moments I've been absolutely hooked! I specialize specifically in building integrations between platforms and thrive in back-end development with extensive experience in HubSpot development.</p>

        <div id="student" class="tag-content">
            <p>At the time of writing, I'm studying to become a Software Engineer at ROCvT located in Almelo (OV) currently in my 3rd year. Learning about software development & code has never been an issue for me, the hard part is designing & engineering a product to near <em>perfection</em> without constantly iterating over the same features.</p>
            <p>My study time-line, 2018 - present</p>

            <p>So what happened between 2023 & 2024? Well, I've had my first internship in February 2024 and it changed my entire perspective on school. I just knew I belonged in the working environment, and so I switched courses from BOL (full-time study) to BBL (Part-time work in the field, Part-time study) and this improved my entire study motivation. Not only did I get to apply my knowledge, which I was very keen on doing; I also got to learn about office etiquette and working in an actual Scrum team.</p>

            <p>From a young age I already figured out that I wasn't made for the school system. I wanted to make money, and I wanted to build something. I've always had an ambition to create something meaningful, and in 2024 I finally started. After learning for a solid 8 years with different languages I figured it was time to start my own company</p>
            <p>My specialisations & interests lie deeply in the server landscape, to a point where I had a Dell PowerEdge R710 in my bedroom! Sleeping through 70 decibels for 2 years straight because I simply refused to turn it off. I love tinkering with servers & networks and that gave me the idea to start a hosting company, which at the time of writing is in active development</p>
            <p>I plan on developing a <em>perfect</em>(ish) system that all folds nicely together, no external tools, all developed in-house. Mainly writing all systems with a combination of PHP, Java, and JavaScript. My vision is to create an affordable hosting service, with future plans to open a foundation to help young people learn new skills that can benefit their future immensly</p>
